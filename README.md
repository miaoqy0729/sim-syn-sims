## Simple Synchrony Simulations

This repository contains the code for a model by Miao, Dale & Galati (2022). It is a simplified linear framework that describes dynamics of synchrony and complementarity, and explores the task-dependence in dyadic interactions. 

The directory contains three R files: 

*functions_2023-05-20.R - functions utilized to generate models and plotting results. 
*simulations_2023-05-20.R - the code to reproduce the simulations reported in the paper. 
*allResults_2022-07-08.Rd - the results data set with 8100 cases, generated in the simulation_2022-07-08.R file.
